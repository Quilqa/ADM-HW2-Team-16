File _main.ipynb_ contains Research Questions 1-8 and Theoretical Questions 1-3.

We loaded and worked on _initial dataset_ and both the _bonus datasets_. It took quite some time for us to do and for the computer to compute, but it could handle everything (barely). We upload the solution for only _initial dataset_ before the deadline, you can vist it in this link: https://github.com/Quilqa/ADM-HW2-Team-16/tree/c9d552810b0c90657235e8bf254635612bc9c10e.

If you have any problems with opening the Jupyter Notebook, then here's the convinient link: https://nbviewer.org/github/Quilqa/ADM-HW2-Team-16/blob/main/main.ipynb

**Note**: in the repository there are some screenshots of running examples of TQ2 algorithm. It's important to download them to see the full answer to the question.
