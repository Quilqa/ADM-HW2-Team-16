File _main.ipynb_ contains Research Questions 1-8 and Theoretical Questions 1-3.

We loaded and worked on _initial dataset_ and both the _bonus datasets_. It took quite some time for us to do and for the computer to compute, but it could handle everything (barely).

If you have any problems with opening the Jupyter Notebook, then here's the convinient link: https://nbviewer.org/github/Quilqa/ADM-HW2-Team-16/blob/main/main.ipynb

**Note**: in the repository there are some screenshots of running examples of TQ2 algorithm. It's important to download them to see the full answer to the question.
